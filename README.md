Python Challenge assessment files

Multiple online sources were used as reference for the two activities
Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56640207/how-to-add-the-date-in-a-for-loop-without-if-else-statements): Used to familiarise with the syntax of some of the variables and functions that have been used in the PyBank activity.

Additionally, the format structure of the coding syntax and functions was sense-checked with similar activities undertaken in the past by separate users. Their GitHub reference links are:
1)https://github.com/saraparveen26/Python---PyBank-and-PyPoll
2)https://github.com/shrawantee/Python-PyBank-and-PyPoll

Finally these syntax and coding formats were also compiled in ChatGPT for reference, especially to sense-check, find cleaner ways of coding to present the data, and resolve errors which  were encountered in the exercise, for example in instances where filepath of the data was not being found by the system, or when issues were being faced from the 'with open' function, especially due to indenting issues.
